🌴 Climate Data Analysis Project
This project explores climate data from a Hawaii-based dataset using Python libraries like SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The objective was to perform precipitation and station analyses to uncover insights about weather patterns and trends.

📊 Precipitation Analysis
Most Recent Date: The dataset's latest entry is from 2017-08-23.

Data for the Last 12 Months: Precipitation data from 2016-08-23 to 2017-08-23 was retrieved and analyzed.

Visualization: A time series plot captured fluctuations in rainfall over the year.

Summary Statistics:

Count: 2021 data points

Mean: 0.177 inches

Min: 0.0 inches

Max: 6.7 inches

The data revealed variability, with precipitation often sparse but showing occasional peaks.

🏔️ Station Analysis
Total Number of Stations: 9 weather stations are included in the dataset.

Most Active Station: USC00519281 emerged as the most active, with 2772 observations.

Temperature Statistics for Most Active Station:

Min Temperature: 54.0°F

Max Temperature: 85.0°F

Average Temperature: 71.66°F

Temperature Observation Data: A histogram showed the distribution of temperature records from the last 12 months, with most temperatures ranging between 60°F and 80°F.

📌 Conclusion
This analysis highlights:

Hawaii's precipitation patterns, characterized by sparse rainfall with occasional spikes.

Detailed insights into temperature trends and variability over the past year.

Identification of the most active weather station and its contribution to the dataset.

Through data visualization and statistical summarization, this project provides a clearer understanding of Hawaii's weather trends.
